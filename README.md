# Flood-Management-project
Many regions or countries are prone to flooding daily, which causes damage to their infrastructure and communities. With the sudden rise in mass coming near coasts or river sides there can be great casualties during floods. Many organisations took steps for these concerns and have implemented many Floods Management models, and here is the one we have created. We took big data collection of the previous floods in the region i.e., “KERALA” from Kaggle and did some research and finally produced the flood prediction system. Accuracy of the model is above 95%, as the accuracy should be good, so the model is working on the good terms. Model is designed in a way that if a different dataset is provided one can easily alter the model and use it accordingly. Model is completely based on AI and is using big data for the data collection and is performing live analysis.
